- Let them believe ideas are theirs

**Example**: When she shares an idea, respond with "That's brilliant! I never would have thought of that."

- Use smoke screens and red herrings
- Talk endlessly about your desires and goals—but not the real ones
- Use decoyed objects of desire

**Example**: Express interest in other women casually to mask your singular focus on her.

---

### Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary
**Principle**: The more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control.

**Application**:
- Master the art of the pause
- Let silence create discomfort that they rush to fill
- Brief, powerful statements carry more weight

**Example**: After she opens up emotionally, respond with just "I understand" and silence.

---
